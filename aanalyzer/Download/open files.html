    <td>This  option will allow you to open any text file. AAnalyzer will recognize columns (or  channels) in the text file if they are separated by a coma, semi colon, space,  or tab, as shown in the following image. Each channel represents a potential  &ldquo;x&rdquo; or &ldquo;y&rdquo; axis.</td>

  <tr>
    <td><p>If your text file contains headers such as this one, you should check  the skip lines box and indicate the number of lines covered by your headers.  You must also indicate whether the channel corresponding to the &ldquo;x&rdquo; axis is  binding or kinetic energy. </p></td>

    <td><p>The &ldquo;data&rdquo; tab also allows the user to modify Shift, Offset, and Gain of  the data. For more information about Shift, Offset, and Gain, please refer to  the &ldquo;Shift, Offset, and Gain options&rdquo; instructional tab.</p></td>

    <td><p>Finally, under the &ldquo;data and fits plot&rdquo; tab, click &ldquo;plot all&rdquo; to view  your data on the graph.</p>
    <p>AAnalyzer  will automatically plot the x axis as kinetic energy using the photon energy of  Al KÎ± (1486.7). If you wish that your x axis be shown as binding energy,  check the &ldquo;use BE&rdquo; box near the lower left corner. If you used a different  photon energy, make sure to input the proper value in the &ldquo;photon energy&rdquo; box.</p></td>

    <p>To save your progress, click the &ldquo;save&rdquo; button  in the upper right corner of the &ldquo;data&rdquo; tab. This will save all information  inputted in the &ldquo;data&rdquo; tab, as well as parameter information in the &ldquo;fitting  parameters&rdquo; tab, if you have any. </p>
    <p>When you  reopen AAnalyzer, you will be able to access any project you worked on by  selecting it in the pop up window mentioned at the beginning of this section.  The last project you saved will be the default file in the open box.</p></td>
